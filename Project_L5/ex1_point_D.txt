D) Discussion – Main Problem

Reconstructing the original DNA sequence from random short fragments is very difficult.
The main issue is that many small fragments can overlap in multiple possible ways.
DNA often contains repetitive or similar regions, so a short overlap (like 10 bases)
can appear several times by coincidence. This causes the algorithm to combine
fragments incorrectly or leave gaps in the final sequence.

Because the samples are random, some regions might not be covered at all,
while others are covered too many times, making it hard to find the correct order.
The algorithm used here is very basic and merges fragments greedily without checking
for consistency or errors.

In real genome assembly, more advanced algorithms are used:
- **De Bruijn graphs** (based on k-mers) to handle repeats more systematically.
- **Overlap–Layout–Consensus (OLC)** graphs for long-read data.
- **Error correction** and **coverage analysis** to detect and fix misassemblies.

So the main problem is that short random reads and repetitive DNA make it impossible
for a simple algorithm to rebuild the correct sequence accurately.
