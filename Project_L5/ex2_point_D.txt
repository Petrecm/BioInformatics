D) Discussion

All ten viral genomes were assembled in ~13.6–14.0 ms, so the points cluster
closely. The small differences mainly come from sequence composition and the
random reads we sample. Higher GC% often brings more stable/repetitive motifs,
which can create extra candidate overlaps and add a bit of work (e.g., V5/V6).
Lower GC% or less repetitive regions tend to assemble slightly faster.

GC% alone doesn’t fully predict time (see V4: high GC but still fast), so the
internal structure (repeats, low-complexity runs, palindromes) matters more
than raw GC%. Our overlap≥10, greedy assembler is simple and ignores global
consistency, so tiny timing shifts also come from random coverage and CPU
jitter. Overall, for short 1–3 kb viral genomes, GC% has only a minor effect.
