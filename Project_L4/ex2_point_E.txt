Prompt:

I analyzed the codon and amino acid frequencies of two viral genomes: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and Influenza A.
For SARS-CoV-2, the three most common amino acids were Leucine, Serine, and Threonine, while for Influenza A they were Arginine, Lysine, and Serine.
Based on general human nutrition knowledge, please explain which common foods or food groups are usually low in each of these amino acids and which are rich in them.
Keep your answer clear and evidence-based, using everyday food examples.

AI Response:

SARS-CoV-2 dominant amino acids: Leucine, Serine, Threonine

Leucine (Leu) – This essential amino acid is most abundant in high-protein foods.
• Foods low in leucine: fruits, refined grains, sugary snacks, and oils, which contain almost no protein.
• Foods rich in leucine: lean meats (chicken, beef, turkey), fish (tuna, salmon), eggs, milk, yogurt, cheese, lentils, and soybeans.

Serine (Ser) – Found in many proteins, but absent from fat- or sugar-based foods.
• Foods low in serine: fruit juices, soft drinks, sweets, and refined cereals.
• Foods rich in serine: soy products, eggs, fish, poultry, nuts, and seeds.

Threonine (Thr) – An essential amino acid important for collagen and muscle tissue.
• Foods low in threonine: most fruits, refined carbohydrates, sweets, and plant oils.
• Foods rich in threonine: cottage cheese, pork, chicken, fish, lentils, and sesame seeds.

Influenza A dominant amino acids: Arginine, Lysine, Serine

Arginine (Arg) – Plays a key role in immune and vascular health.
• Foods low in arginine: dairy products, most fruits, and refined grains.
• Foods rich in arginine: pumpkin seeds, peanuts, walnuts, turkey, pork, chickpeas, and lentils.

Lysine (Lys) – Essential for tissue repair and calcium absorption.
• Foods low in lysine: cereals (wheat, rice, corn), processed bakery products, and gelatin-based desserts.
• Foods rich in lysine: eggs, chicken, beef, cod, tofu, beans, and peas.

Serine (Ser) – Common to both viruses’ top amino acids, highlighting its general importance.
• Foods low in serine: sugary foods, refined flour, and drinks with no protein.
• Foods rich in serine: eggs, soy, fish, poultry, and legumes.

Summary:
In general, low-protein foods such as fruits, refined grains, sweets, and oils tend to lack these amino acids, while protein-rich foods — meat, fish, eggs, dairy, soy, legumes, and seeds — provide abundant amounts.
A balanced, high-protein diet naturally covers all six of these amino acids.
